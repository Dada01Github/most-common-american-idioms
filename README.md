# Most Common American Idioms (1355)

This book was created by [@xiaolai](https://twitter.com/xiaolai) with the help of ChatGPT and its TTS. The rough code can be found in the notebook: [Idiom_book.ipynb](Idiom_book.ipynb). The program ran for about 5 hours to complete all the work.

The final work is available in [Most_Common_American_Idioms.html](Most_Common_American_Idioms.html), and the audios can be played directly from the browser.

The individual audio files are in the `audio` directory, and another version with combined files (every 10 idioms) is in the `combined` directory.

Also, you can download a compiled version from [Baidu NetDisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1pvZU9dCO-kBuGl4BUd7efw?pwd=rawv), html/pdf/epub versions included:
